# GPT From Scratch (Inspired by Andrej Karpathy)

This project is my attempt to build a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model from the ground up, drawing inspiration from Andrej Karpathy's insightful tutorial and code.  I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of these powerful language models by implementing them using basic libraries like NumPy.

## What is GPT?

GPT models are a type of large language model (LLM) that use deep learning, specifically a transformer architecture, to generate human-quality text. They can be used for tasks like:

* Text generation: Writing stories, articles, or even code.
* Translation: Converting text from one language to another.
* Question answering: Providing answers to questions based on given information.
* Summarization: Condensing large amounts of text into shorter summaries.

## What We Implemented

In this project, I've implemented the core components of a GPT model, including:

* **Transformer encoder blocks:** The fundamental building blocks of the GPT architecture, responsible for processing and encoding the input text.
* **Self-attention mechanism:** This allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input when generating output, enabling it to capture context and relationships between words.
* **Feedforward neural networks:** These networks process the encoded information from the self-attention mechanism to generate the final output.

## How to Run This Project
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the training script:**
   Execute the main training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
   This script will train the GPT model on a small text dataset. You can modify the script to use a different dataset or adjust the model's hyperparameters.

## Additional Notes

* This project is intended for educational purposes and to provide a deeper understanding of GPT models. It is not meant to be a production-ready implementation.
* The model is trained on a small dataset due to resource constraints. Training on larger datasets would require significantly more compute power and time.
* I've included comments throughout the code to explain the logic and implementation details.
